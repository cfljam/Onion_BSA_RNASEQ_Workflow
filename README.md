## Workflow for BSA-RNASEQ analysis targetting onion *AcBlt1* locus and other QTL affecting Bolting (precocious flowering)##

Each directory is a discrete step in the analysis

Reproducible workflows docuemnted in 3 ways:

1. Unix shell workflows originally created using  the MOA Command-line Bioinformatics framework. See http://moa.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html. Most steps are  unix shell commands (MOA 'simple' template) visible in the .moa/config file. These are executed in order precommand -> process -> postcommand. Equivalent shell scripts provided as **run.sh** 
2. R Markdown as **Rmd** files
3. iPython notebooks
