##Workflow for BSA-RNASEQ analysis targetting onion *AcBlt1* locus and other QTL affecting Bolting (precocious flowering)##

Workflow originally created for the MOA Command-line Bioinformatics framework
See http://moa.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html

Each directory is a discrete step in the analysis

Most steps are  unix shell commands (MOA 'simple' template) visible in the .moa/config file
These are executed in order precommand -> process -> postcommand

Equivalent shell scripts provided as **run.sh**
