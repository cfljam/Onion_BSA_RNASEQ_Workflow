Scripts for design of PCR-based Marker Assays from DNA sequence variant data, and xml wrappers for use in Galaxy workflow environment

Source code and supporting information may also be accessed at https://github.com/cfljam/galaxy-pcr-markers

NOTE that the primer design tools rely on EMBOSS ePrimer3 which depends on Primer3 1.1.4. We are working to add automatic tool dependency management for Galaxy
